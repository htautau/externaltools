"externaltools" is a package for easily checking out and building all of the
"external" tools we use (MissingMassCalculator, PileupReweighting,
TauTriggerCorrections, etc.)

The file "packages.txt" contains a list of the packages and the format of each
line is as follows:

[package name] [path to package (trunk, or a specific tag or branch) in svn]

Please add any additional packages.

Then to checkout all packages:

./fetch [username]

and to build all packages:

./waf

to install libraries in ./externaltools/lib

./waf install

to clean:

./build clean
